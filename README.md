####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

* [Measuring with Navigation Timing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/measure-crp.html "nav timing api"). We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

function determineDx = changed querySelector to getElementById

saved array of randomPizzaContainers in window.pizzasContainers right after they are all created.

function  changePizzaSizes = changed all pizza array references to window.pizzasContainers
moved dx and newwidth calcs outside for loop.

function updatePositions - moved position calcs outside of loop. there are only 5 possible values, so i put them in an array and just loop through the array as needed for the calculation inside the for loop.
changed all pizza array references to movingPizzas


DOMContentLoaded event listener:
dropped number of movers from 200 to 60
changed querySelector to getElementById
saved array of movingPizzas in window.movingPizzas right after they are all created.


added requestAnimationFrame to scroll event listener per a recommendation from the discussion forum.
